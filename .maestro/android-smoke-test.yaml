# Android Smoke Test - Verifies the app launches and basic UI is visible
# This test runs on every build to ensure the Android app is functional

appId: space.haex.vault
---
# Launch the app
- launchApp:
    clearState: true

# Wait for the app to fully load
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible: ".*"
    timeout: 30000

# Take a screenshot of the initial state
- takeScreenshot: 01-app-launched

# The app should show either:
# 1. Welcome/onboarding screen (first launch)
# 2. Login/unlock screen (if vault exists)
# We just verify the app renders something

# Try to find common UI elements that should be visible on first launch
- assertVisible:
    text: ".*"
    optional: true

# Take final screenshot
